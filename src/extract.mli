(** Extract an active path from a formula given a model

    @author Christoph Sticksel *)

(** Extract an active path from a formula and return a conjunction
    that is true in the model given.

    Assumption: the formula is satisfiable under the given partial
    assignment. Then, return an active path [g] in the formula [f],
    that is, a formula [g] that must be satisfied if the formula [f] is
    satisfied. *)
