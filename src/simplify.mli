(** Term simplifier 

    Simplify a term by evaluating operations with constants. 

    Integer and real terms are converted to polynomials, terms in that
    cannot be reduced to addition or linear multiplication become new
    variables in the polynomials.

    Boolean terms are converted to negation normal form, such that
    only the operators conjunction, disjunction and negation occur.

    Relations between polynomials such as [c + a*x > d + b*y] are
    converted to [c - d + a*x - b*y > 0] where [c-d > 0] or [c-d = 0]
    and [a>0] if term [x] is ordered before term [y]m otherwise [b>0].

    Let bindings are unfolded. In order to evaluate a term with a
    partial model for its variables, bind each variable in the model
    to its value or use the convenience function
    {!simplify_term_model}. To make a model total, give a function in
    the optional argument [~default_of_var] that returns the value to
    assign to the variable given as parameter.

(** Simplify a term given an assignment to variables

    The optional parameter [default_of_var] may be a function that
    assigns a default value per variable, for example, to smooth a
    partially defined model. The defaults for variables must not be
    circular, otherwise the simplification will cycle. *)
